Rimbaud was a poet and arms dealer known for his influence on modern literature and arts, which prefigured surrealism. Born in Charleville, he started writing at a very young age and excelled as a student. During his late adolescence and early adulthood he began the bulk of his literary output, then completely stopped writing at the age of 20.
Rimbaud was known to have been a libertine and a restless soul, having engaged in an at-times-violent romantic relationship with fellow poet Paul Verlaine
